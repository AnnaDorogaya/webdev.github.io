         <p>Hello! My name is Anna Dorogaya and I am a digital designer based in Vancouver BC. (Canada)</p>
         <p>Ever since I was younger I had a passion for creativity. After finishing school in Ukraine I decided to study English and German philology.  I have bachelor degree in English and German and studied English and American studies and History of Art for one year in Hamburg (Germany) for second bachelor degree.  I decided to change my field of study for something more creative and now I’m in the Digital Design and Development program in BCIT.</p>
         <p>Today I am in my 2nd semester looking forward to receiving my Diploma. I realized that graphic design and content creation are already interesting for me. I also have skills in social media marketing, branding, UI/UX design, video and picture editing and knowledge of basic html and css. When I’m not sitting in front of my computer, you can find me creating new social media content, catching up on the latest fashion, taking pictures, or hitting the shops for some new outfits. Aside from design, I also have a passion for fashion, movies and travelling. I love adventures and explore every day new places to get more inspiration. My future plans are to find a job in a creative field, explore new countries and create new content for myself and my future clients.</p>
